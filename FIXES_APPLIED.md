# Fixes Applied - Registration & Chatbot Issues

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Error (HTTP 400 - Validation Failed)

**Problem:**
- Frontend was sending `undefined` values for optional fields
- Backend validation was rejecting the request due to improper field formatting
- Phone number validation wasn't trimming whitespace

**Solution:**
‚úÖ **Frontend (`Register.jsx`):**
- Changed to only send fields that have actual values
- Cleaned up registration data object to exclude undefined/empty fields
- Added conditional logic to only include address object if at least one address field is filled

‚úÖ **Backend (`validation.js`):**
- Added `.trim()` to phone validation to handle whitespace
- Phone validation now properly accepts 10-digit Indian mobile numbers starting with 6-9

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (sending undefined values)
const result = await register({
  firstName: formData.firstName,
  address: {
    city: formData.address.city || undefined,  // ‚ùå Sending undefined
  }
});

// After (clean data)
const registrationData = {
  firstName: formData.firstName,
  // ... required fields
};
if (formData.address.city) {
  registrationData.address = { city: formData.address.city };  // ‚úÖ Only if has value
}
```

### 2. Chatbot Not Responding

**Problem:**
- Chatbot was calling wrong API endpoint (`/api/qa/ask` instead of `/api/chatbot/query`)
- Request body format didn't match backend expectations
- Response format wasn't being parsed correctly

**Solution:**
‚úÖ **Frontend (`Chatbot.jsx`):**
- Changed API endpoint from `/api/qa/ask` to `/api/chatbot/query`
- Updated request body to send `{ message: inputMessage }` instead of complex object
- Fixed response parsing to handle both `response` and `answer` fields
- Added fallback for suggestions array

‚úÖ **Backend (`chatbot.js`):**
- Already integrated with Google Gemini AI
- Properly configured to use GOOGLE_API_KEY from environment
- Generates intelligent responses with context-aware suggestions

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (wrong endpoint)
const response = await apiCall('/api/qa/ask', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    question: inputMessage,  // ‚ùå Wrong field name
    language: selectedLanguage
  })
});

// After (correct endpoint)
const response = await apiCall('/api/chatbot/query', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: inputMessage  // ‚úÖ Correct field name
  })
});
```
